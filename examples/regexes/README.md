You may launch this example in this repository with

```
cargo run
```

and that would do nothing.

If you want some log, set the env var `SMALL_APP_LOG`, for example with

```
SMALL_APP_LOG=info cargo run
```

or

```
SMALL_APP_LOG=debug cargo run
```

A `small-app.log` file would thus be created.
